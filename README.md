### What is it?
I created a website which is based on the "Little Man Computer" system that models the architecture of a
simple computer with basic instructions. In addition to this, I developed an assembly code editor that acts
similarly to a modern IDE, with syntax highlighting. The program compiles any user-inputted assembly code
and displays it on the model of a CPU, moving "blobs" to illustrate the computerâ€™s operation.
